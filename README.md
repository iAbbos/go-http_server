# HTTP Server in Golang #
This project showcases my attempt to create a fully functional HTTP server using Golang.

## Features ##
    - Handles basic HTTP requests and responses
    - Supports concurrent connections
    - Implements essential HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
    - Follows standard HTTP/1.1 protocol
    - Customizable to add more features

## Getting Started ##
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites ###
Make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed on your machine.

### Installation ###
1. Clone the repository:
~~~sh 
git clone https://github.com/iAbbos/go-http_server.git
~~~  
2. Navigate to the project directory:
~~~sh 
cd go-http_server
~~~ 
3. Build and run the server:
~~~sh 
go run app/main.go
~~~  

## Usage ##
Once the server is running, you can test it by sending HTTP requests using a tool like curl or Postman, or by simply opening a browser and navigating to http://localhost:4221.
